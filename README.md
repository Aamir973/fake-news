# üì∞ Fake News Detection App

This project is a machine learning-powered **Fake News Detection** web application built using **Python** and **Streamlit**. It utilizes multiple classification models to determine whether a news article is fake or real.

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset Description

We use two CSV files: `Fake.csv` and `True.csv`.

Each file contains the following columns:

- `title`: The headline of the news article
- `text`: The full content/body of the article
- `subject`: The topic/label the article belongs to (e.g., politics, news, world)
- `date`: The publishing date of the article

- `Fake.csv`: Contains fake news articles
- `True.csv`: Contains real news articles

> During preprocessing, only the `text` column is used for model training. The other columns are dropped.

  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project demonstrates the successful application of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning** techniques for detecting fake news. By training multiple classifiers like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest on real-world news data, we built a robust and interactive web app that can classify news articles as fake or real with significant accuracy.

The application also serves as an excellent foundation for understanding:
- Text preprocessing
- Feature extraction (TF-IDF)
- Model comparison
- Web deployment using Streamlit

## üöÄ Future Improvements

Here are several ways this project can be enhanced:

- **Real-time News Feed Integration**: Use APIs (e.g., NewsAPI) to analyze live news content.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Implement LSTM, BERT, or Transformer-based models for improved accuracy on long and complex texts.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Add SHAP or LIME explanations to show why the model predicted a certain output.
- **User Feedback Loop**: Allow users to vote on the prediction accuracy and use the feedback for model improvement.
